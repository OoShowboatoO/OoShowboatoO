ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Nino Ding, a passionate software engineer and currently a Master of Engineering candidate in Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto. My journey in tech began with a strong foundation in Computer Science from the University of Waterloo, where I honed my skills in software development, machine learning, and cloud computing.

ðŸŒŸ I'm driven by the challenge of solving complex problems and building scalable, reliable systems. My experience spans full-stack development, with a particular focus on back-end APIs and front-end interfaces using technologies like JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, and MySQL. At Adknown, I had the opportunity to take end-to-end ownership of projects, from developing backend services to enhancing user experiences on the frontend.

ðŸš€ On the side, I've worked on some exciting projects, including a reinforcement learning model for Breakout-v4 that integrates Deep Q-Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks, demonstrating the critical impact of action uncertainty on learning outcomes. I also developed a predictive analytics model for early lung cancer detection, achieving a 97% accuracy rate with Linear SVM.

ðŸ’» Iâ€™m always excited to collaborate on innovative projects, contribute to open-source software, and continue expanding my skill set. Whether it's diving into a new programming language or exploring the latest in machine learning, I'm up for the challenge!

ðŸ”— Feel free to check out my repositories and connect with me! I'm always open to learning from and collaborating with others in the tech community.
